should be quickly reversionable to have different table structure
and cope with differing numbers of textareas without modification to
the code

does not save to local storeage

to reversion:
	- change html in index.html
	
to deploy:
	- see sample stub Structured Content document
	- note that the second and third instances have a "parent_activity_id" parameter, which
	  points to the id of the first one
	- doesn't have to be three instances: could be one or any number within the same document
