Dataplus
--------
started by .. worked on by Jane
needs reworking for a future presentation
100 students max. (so should be ok for javascript reading-in of record data)
see mail from Frances Walton 26 March 2014

Dinar would like it a bit wider if possible.

VLE Blog
--------
Can a structure be imposed? At present, students' entries for different parts of the course are mixed up with each other.
- is the Glossary tool an alternative?
- Robert Wood suggested a solution using existing VLE functionality: just divide into separate blogs and maybe have a way-in page.

Y033
==== Lindsey for deadlines
Open Design Studio - preparing the 14B presentation : deadline Wednesday 12 March (??)
---------------------------------------------------

share : hsc-y033 (nighthawk/palmcreeper)

Need to get spreadsheet from Online Services with Tutor/Student Allocations (the 'TSA table').
They get it from Circe.
This has been done for 13J - find out when it needs to be done for 14B.

The PHP script ( importTSA.php ? ) fills the:
 .. groupmembers and
 .. groups 
 tables. 
 If there are missing oucus, can get those from the VLE site (click on the Users link)
 Check Sams files.
 
Open Design Studio - examples page
----------------------------------
- Tina Forbes created the page and called it: "Y033 module team"
- you can find it by using the search
- would like to copy this over from 13J to 14B
- lose the student comments
- should be a matter of: a) copying the images; b) running a query to *copy* the entries in the image table

Open Design Studio - setting up for examiners
---------------------------------------------
check if Adrian had a response from exams
what actually gets assessed?
who can see what?
